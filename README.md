# FCoQt
Frame comparator designed to work with two video files with equal framerate and frame count. 

## Usage
The program requires two videos that can either be specified via terminal or dragged into the window. 
If a third file is dragged in it will replace the first video and unset the second video, with a fourth video replacing the second and so on. 

## Shortcuts
**(Up)** ------ Change the source to video1

**(Down)** --- Change the source to video2

**(Right)** ---- Next frame

**(Left)** ------ Previous frame

**(C)** --------- Centralize the screen

**(S)** --------- Resize to source

**(A)** --------- Toggle aspect ratio

**(Q)** --------- Exit

## To do*
* File preview when only one video is added
* Testing to prevent crashes with invalid files (unsuported formats, different frame count) and text warnings
* Frame seek
* Toggleable loop
* Heat map outlying frame differences 
* Knockout tournament selection for more than two videos 
*
*\*While a to do section implies some degree of interest in continuing development I most likely won't.*
